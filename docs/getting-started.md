## Introduction

This site is the central page for all repositories and modules that come with VSTeam. VSTeam is a bundle of PowerShell modules to access and get you started with [Azure DevOps Server (previously named Visual Studio Team Foundation Server) 2017/2018](https://cda.ms/Bf) and [Azure DevOps Services (previously named Visual Studio Team Services)](https://cda.ms/Bf).

### Module VSTeam

This module is basically inly a wrapper for the API and tries to keep things simple. More complex functions with multiple steps are not allowed with this.

Check [the repository](https://github.com/MethodsAndPractices/vsteam) for the code (and contribute) or [the docs](modules/vsteam/index.md) for getting started.

### Module VSTeam Plus

This module builds up on the VSTeam module and is a module of "super-luxury" functions. These can be more comfortable to make automation more simple and only cmdlets from VSTeam are used. This module is not accessing the API directly.

Check [the repository](https://github.com/MethodsAndPractices/vsteam-plus) for the code and to contribute.


### Quickstart Scripts

This repository is a place with a collection of best practice scripts to get you started and the can map certain scenarios you might find useful. They use all modules and can include more complex scenarios and full automation samples. Some are to get you started and many that are supposed to have value in your daily work.
